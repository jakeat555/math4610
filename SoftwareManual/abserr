**Routine Name:** abserr

**Author:** Jacob Johns

**Language:** C++. The code can be compiled using the GNU C++ compiler (g++).

For example,

    g++ abserr.f

will produce an executable **./a.exe** than can be executed. If you want a different name, the following will work a bit
better

    g++ -o abserr abserr.f

**Description/Purpose:** This code is meant to evaluate the absolute error of two numbers, defined to be the absolute value of the difference of the two

**Input:** The inputs for abserr one double, passed by refercence and  two doubles, which are not passed by reference. Input eps is the epsilon that you are trying to calculate.
Input x and xe are the value and the estimated value respectivly.

**Output:** There is no output as the variable eps is passed by refernce and thus carries all the relevant information gathered from abserr

**Usage/Example:**

abserr(eps,1.1,1.001)
printf("The absolute error is: %f",eps);
    Output: "The absolute error is: .09"
    
abserr(eps,1.1,1.001)
printf("The absolute error is: %f",eps);
    Output: "The absolute error is: .009"

**Implementation/Code:** The following is the code for abserr()
#include<cmath>
void abserr(double &eps, double x, double xe){
	eps = abs(x - xe);
}
