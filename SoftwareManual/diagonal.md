**Routine Name:** diagonal

**Author:** Jacob Johns

**Language:** C++. The code can be compiled using the GNU C++ compiler (g++).

For example,

    g++ diagonal.cpp

will produce an executable **./a.exe** than can be executed. If you want a different name, the following will work a bit
better

    g++ -o diagonal diagonal.cpp

**Description/Purpose:** This method transfroms a square matrix into a diagonal matrix, meaning that the only non zero values are on the main diagonal (where the row and column index are the same).

**Input:** This function takes a matrix `A` of size `(nxn)` that has an inverse `P` such that `PAP^{-1}` is diagonal.

**Output:** The output of this method is a matrix of size `(nxn)`

**Usage/Example:**



**Implementation/Code:** The following is the code for diagonal
