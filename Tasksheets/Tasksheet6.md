# Task 1
Write a code that implements a Cholesky factorization of a real matrix. Include a check on the matrix to make sure it is symmetric. Put an entry in your software manual that documents the method.

# Task 3
Write a routine that will create a square matrix with dimension `n`. Use a random number generator to determine the entries in the matrix. You can use a uniform distribution as the basis for the values created. Put a page in for this method.

# Task 6 (not done)
Repeat Task 3 with output that is both symmetric and diagonally dominant.

# Task 7 (not done)
Use each of the matrix generation routines with your Jacobi iteration to test the code. You should generate a matrix with dimension `n` with `n` large, create the right hand side of the system by multiplying the matrix on the left into a vector of ones. Then solve the resulting system. You solutions should be close to 1 if your Jacobi iteration is working.

## Solution

# Task 8 (not done)
Implement the Gauss-Seidel method for solving linear systems of equations. Include a software manual page for this method.

## Solution
Check out the solution [here](https://github.com/jakeat555/math4610/blob/master/SoftwareManual/gaussSeidel.md)

# Task 9 (not done)
Run the Gauss-Seidel iteration on the same matrices as you created in Task 7. Compare the results of the Jacobi iteration runs to the Gauss-Seidel runs. This means keeping track of the number of iterations for each method.

## Solution

# Task 10 (not done)
Search the internet for sites that document the use of Jacobi iteration and/or Gauss-Seidel. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
