# Task 1
Implement the Method of Steepest Descent for solving linear systems of equations. Put an entry in your software manual that documents the method. Include an example using the diagonally dominant matrix generation routine from the previous tasksheet.

## Solution
Check out my solution [here](https://github.com/jakeat555/math4610/blob/master/SoftwareManual/steepestDescent.md) with the usage/example using the previously made matrix generation.

# Task 2 (not done)
Tryout your steepest descent method on a sequence of matrices based on the Hilbert matrix. Start with `n=4` and see how far you can go increasing `n`.

## Solution


# Task 3 (not done)
Implement the Conjugate Gradient method for solving linear systems of equations. Keep in mind that you will need to test the method on a symmetric, positive definite matrix. Create and include a software page for the conjugate gradient method in your software manual.

# Task 4 (not done)
As a test of the steepest descent method versus the conjugate gradient method, write code to do the following. First, generate a square symmetric diagonally dominant matrix - you have already created such a method. Then report the number of iterations required to produce a solution to the linear system. Generate the right hand side of the system of equations using `b=Av` where all the entries of `v`are 1.

## Solution


# Task 5 (not done)
Compare your results in Task 4 to the use of Gaussian Elimination with backsubstitution. Report the amount of time it takes to compute the solution of the linear system for steepest descent, the conjugate gradient method, and Gaussian elimination.

## Solution


# Task 6 (not done)
Repeat the work in Task 5 but use Jacobi iteration instead of Gaussian elimination. Again, which runs faster.

## Solution


# Task 7 (not done)
Repeat Task 6 using Gauss-Seidel instead of Jacobi Iteration.

## Solution


# Task 8  (not done)
Implement a matrix multiplication routine for a tridiagonal matrix that avoids as many computations with zeros as possible. Use the vector form of matrix storage to store the three nonzero diagonals. Create a software manual page for the method.

## Solution

# Task 9 (not done)
Create an analogous routine where the matrix is penta-diagonal with two diagonals above and below the main diagonal of the matrix. Use 5 vectors to store the matrix. As always, document the method in your software manual.

# Task (not done)
10 Search the internet for sites that document the use of conjugate gradient methods. Write a brief paragraph (3 or 4 sentences) that describe your findings. Include links to the sites you cite.
